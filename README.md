#ChessPredictionProject - Ongoing

This project enables real-time chess analysis and move optimization to gain an advantage in a game. Using your mobile camera to scan the chessboard, it detects the current board state, analyzes positions, and suggests the best moves. By leveraging YOLO for piece detection and Stockfish for strategic insights, the system delivers powerful recommendations to help you navigate the game and make optimal moves toward victory.
